# WhatFlower

## Goal

Learn Advanced CoreML tools and how to convert models through a fun project.

## What I created

WhatFlower is an app that analyzes a photo of a flower given to it and identifies the flower using a machine learning model. The app then displays a wikipedia snippet about the flower and a corresponding photo of the identified flower. Pretty cool!


## What I learned

* How to convert machine learning models to CoreML models with python scripts
* Wikipedia API
* Using machine learning to identify flowers
* Using UIImagePicker class
